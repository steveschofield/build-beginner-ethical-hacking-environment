# Misc Pentesting steps

Part of a penetration test is checking for malware vulnerabilities. When performing a penetration test, the penetration tester follows a set of steps:

1. Scan for open ports.
2. Scan for running processes.
3. Check for suspicious or unknown registry entries.
4. Verify all running Windows services.
5. Check startup programs.
6. Look through event log for suspicious events.
7. Verify all installed programs.
8. Scan files and folders for manipulation.
9. Verify that device drivers are legitimate.
10. Check all network and DNS settings and activity.
11. Scan for suspicious API calls.
12. Run anti-malware scans.
13. Document results and findings.
