# **CyberSecurity Ethical Hacker Lessons**

Load up a hypervisor; Hyper-V on win10/11 or VMware Workstation or VMware fusion.   I prefer these two as well as Virtualbox is an option.    

After you manually setup each a few times, use an automation tool like Vagrant or template.

 1 - Setup Ubuntu Server

 2 - Setup FreeBSD (using pre-config hard
drive)

 3 - Install and get Docker or Podman working / hosting on Ubuntu Server

 4 - Download from github and install DVWA vulnerable app and run within docker container

 5 - Install Web tools, browse [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) running in a container or [JuiceShop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop)

 6 - Find [Metasploitable](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/) 2 or [Metasploitable 3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3) virtual machines setup in your Hypervisor

 7 - Setup Kali Linux VM or a container

# How do I get experience?

This is probably one of the most asked questions.  Are certifications enough?  Is starting at the help desk a good start?   For me personally, I learned a lot on my own spending hours in my homelab, when opportunities come up, having reference to talk about a situation and what you learned.  There is a lot of articles, but these are the few I share with people who ask for guidance and experience.

* Setup a local lab at your house also know as #homelab.   I have two 2014 Dell Optiplex with 16 GB of RAM, 256 SSD and use multiple USB to Ethernet to provide more network attachments.
* Volunteer at your local church
* Volunteer or inquire if local non-profits need tech help
* Write articles about your experiences in homelab
* Network at local conferences
* Sharing from @ [https://x.com/cyberchenti](https://x.com/cyberchenti)
