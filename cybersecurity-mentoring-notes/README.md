# How do I get experience?

This is probably one of the most asked questions.  Are certifications enough?  Is starting at the help desk a good start?   For me personally, I learned a lot on my own spending hours in my homelab, when opportunities come up, having reference to talk about a situation and what you learned.  There is a lot of articles, but these are the few I share with people who ask for guidance and experience.

* Setup a local lab at your house also know as #homelab.   I have two 2014 Dell Optiplex with 16 GB of RAM, 256 SSD and use multiple USB to Ethernet to provide more network attachments.
* Volunteer at your local church
* Volunteer or inquire if local non-profits need tech help
* Write articles about your experiences in homelab
* Network at local conferences
* Sharing from @ [https://x.com/cyberchenti](https://x.com/cyberchenti)
