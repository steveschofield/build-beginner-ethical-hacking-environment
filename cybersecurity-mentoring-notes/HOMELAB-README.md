# Home Lab Ideas

Always, Always if you can have a controlled environment that is under your control, equipment you understand and can directly access, will help in your IT and CyberSecurity journey.My homelab depends on my obsession at the time or area of focus.   Many years was website development.  I've hosted websites, blogs and many other things.

Here are some ideas:

* Bought a domain name
* Setup name servers on the domain to point to servers at my home
* Setup websites at my home
* Setup mail servers on my domain
* Add additional DNS records to allow me to send email from gmail, other free services to my domain.
* Setup active directory (using eval windows systems) - I've done many many things in the microsoft.  About every service feature and role.   AD is always the foundation.
* Setup Linux systems to use AD for dns
* Setup PAT to forward to an pfsense requests from external and setup a private vlan with additional vms behind pfsense.  The pfsense had two interfaces, one external (which received requests externally) and forwarded to systems in private network PAT rules setup on pfsense.
* Setup VPN's (wireguard and others)
* If I see a lab setup in our classes, I'd try to replicate that.
* Hackthebox and Tryhackme have ideas.
* Vulnlab has predone systems.
* My current obsession has been ethical hacking.
  * Setup VM's with sample vuln systems DVWA and Juiceshop
* Using metasploit2 and metasploit3 VM's (search on rapid7 and github)

# Goals to learn

* Learn internet protocols like DNS, SMTP, TCP/IP, FTP (scp)
* How websites work
* Secure infrastructure and setup your own servers
