# Run Metaploitable 2 and 3 on MacBook M-series

This article covers how to run metasploitable 2 and 3 on a MacBook M-series cpu.    Metaploitable 2 is provided by Rapid7 and configured to run on x86/64 chipset.  MacBook has the Apple Silicon.  Metasploitable "is a purpose built vulnerable system" to play and learn with.   There is an Ubuntu and windows machine available (also know as Metasploitable 3). 

As part of my passion to share experiences on a localhost environment.   Hopefully this will help on your journey for cybersecurity and IT.

**Assumptions**

* Running MacBook with M-chips
* [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) installed on MacBook (or https://brew.sh)
* UTM hypervisor installed via brew
