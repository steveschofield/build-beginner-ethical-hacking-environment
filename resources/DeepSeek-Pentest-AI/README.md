## My desire is run with Ollama and local models for offensive security testing for educational purposes.  For testing, I'm using **gdisney/mistral-uncensored:latest**.  This is for EDUCATIONAL purposes.  Make sure all attempts are against resources you have permission or authority to do this.  I recommend running locally on your home network against things like #OWASP Juiceshop or #DVWA

## Assumptions

* Burp Pro subscription
* Ollama Installed Locally
* Running a model (I'm usinggdisney/mistral-uncensored:latest)
* I hard coded values inside the python script
* Jython extension is setup in Burp Pro

## Description

DeepSeek Pentest AI is a Burp Suite extension that combines generative AI with smart fuzzing to automate payload generation and vulnerability testing in web applications.

- Generate advanced payloads using the DeepSeek API.
- Automatically detect parameters (GET, POST, JSON, XML, multipart, special headers).
- Inject payloads into live requests and evaluate responses with heuristic scoring.
- Real-time metrics with vulnerability-type charts.
- Export results to CSV.
- Direct integration with Repeater and Intruder.

---

## Features

- API Key management (DeepSeek).
- Payload generation for multiple attack types:
  SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection, Path Traversal, LFI, SSRF, RCE, SSTI, XXE, NoSQL Injection, GraphQL, Open Redirect, CRLF, CORS, Host Header Injection.
- Automatic parameter detection across multiple locations (query, body, JSON, XML, multipart, headers).
- Intelligent fuzzing:
  Payload injection,
  Baseline comparison,
  Severity and confidence scoring,
  Evidence snippet for detected vulnerabilities.
- Real-time metrics and visualization (integrated BarChart).
- Full request/response history tracking.
- CSV export (all requests, only vulnerabilities, or evidence-only).
- One-click send to Repeater and Intruder.
- Privacy-first approach:
  Host is always redacted (redacted.example),
  Parameters are sent to AI without real values.

Go to the DeepSeek Pentest AI tab:

- Enter your API Key. **https://platform.deepseek.com/**
- Select the attack type.
- Set number of payloads and delay.

Click:

- Analyze & Generate → to generate payloads.

- AI Analysis → generated payloads.
- Results → findings in text.
- Metrics → stats and charts.

## CUSTOM PROMPT

The **CUSTOM PROMPT** option allows you to define your own instructions for payload generation.
Instead of selecting a predefined attack type (SQLi, XSS, etc.), you can enter a custom text prompt that will be sent to the AI.
This gives you flexibility to request very specific or creative payloads tailored to your testing scenario.

Example:

- Custom Prompt: `Give me payloads SQLi boolean bypass WAF`
- Result: The AI will return a list of SQLi Boolean payloads instead of following the built-in strategies.

```bash
'OR'1
''1
'/**/OR/**/'1
'/*!OR*/'1
'OR'1'=''1
'OR'1'LIKE'1
'OR'1'REGEXP'1
'OR'1'RLIKE'1
'OR'1'IN('1')
'OR'1'BETWEEN'1'AND'1
'OR'1'^'1'='0
OR'1
'OR'1'|'1'='1
'OR'1'<<'1'='2
'OR'1'%'1'='0
'OR'1'DIV'1'='1
'OR'1'XOR'0
'OR'1'='1'--'-
OR'1'='1
OR'1'='1'/*
'OR'1'='1'//*
'OR'1'='1''1'='1
'OR'1'='1'//AND//'1'='1
'OR'1'='1'/*!AND*/'1'='1
'OR'TRUE
'OR'NOT'0
'OR'1'<>'0
'OR'1'!='0
'OR'1'='1'LIMIT'1
```
