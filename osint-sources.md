# Honeypots

Bait and switch - SNORT

| Honeyd                 | Honeyd is used to create thousands of honeypots. Honeyd can act as a distraction to potential attackers. It works as follows:* Honeyd is installed on one network server. The network appears to the attacker to be running hundreds of servers when it actually has far fewer servers.* To avoid getting caught in the honeypot, the attacker has to research which servers are real.* The attacker is slowed down or discovered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Pentbox                | Pentbox is a security suite package that provides (among other things) various network tools, such as Net DoS Tester, TCP port scanner, Honeypot, Fuzzer, DNS and host gathering, and Mac address geolocation. It was written primarily for Linux-based systems but is compatible with MacOS and Windows. You can configure Pentbox using the Fast Auto Configuration option or manually. The manual method lets you configure which port to listen on and a false message that can be shown when an attack happens. To set up a honeypot with Pentbox:1. Download and install Pentbox.1. Change to the Pentbox directory and type**./Pentbox.rb**1. Choose option **2- Network tools** and then option **3- Honeypot**1. Select the applicable configuration option:* **1- Fast Auto Configuration*** **2- Manual Configuration**Pentbox is now listening and recording any attempt to access the server on which Pentbox was installed. |
| User-Mode Linux``(UML) | UML is an open-source tool that is efficient at creating virtual machines to deploy honeypots.``UML uses a fake IDE device named /dev/ubd*. An attacker can detect UML by the following system files:* /proc/mounts* /proc/interrupts* /proc/cmdline``Another sign of UML is the usage of the TUN/TAP backend for the network device 0, which is not common on a real system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Sebek                  | Sebek is a server/client-based honeypot application that captures rootkits and other malware that hijack read() system calls.``An attacker can detect Sebek by measuring the execution time of the read() system call. On a system without Sebek, minimal time is around 8225, and the physical is 0.776282                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Snort inline           | Snort inline is a modified version of Snort IDS that is capable of packet manipulation. Snort rules must be on a single line; the parser does not handle rules on multiple lines.``An attacker might notice the packet manipulation if the rule logic appears altered. The attacker must be highly knowledgeable of Snort inline and have the ability to sniff the IDS traffic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Fake access point (AP) | Security analysts can use fake APs to create fake 802.11 beacon frames with randomly generated ESSID and BSSID (MAC address) assignments.``Attackers can use many ESSID and BSSID validation tools to detect fake APs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Bait and switch        | Bait and switch technology works with IDS software, typically Snort. The technology detours suspected malicious traffic into a honeypot that mirrors or closely resembles the real network. The attacker carries out the attack against the honeypot.``The attacker must be skilled enough to detect the detour or honeypot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

# Misc Pentesting steps

Part of a penetration test is checking for malware vulnerabilities. When performing a penetration test, the penetration tester follows a set of steps:

1. Scan for open ports.
2. Scan for running processes.
3. Check for suspicious or unknown registry entries.
4. Verify all running Windows services.
5. Check startup programs.
6. Look through event log for suspicious events.
7. Verify all installed programs.
8. Scan files and folders for manipulation.
9. Verify that device drivers are legitimate.
10. Check all network and DNS settings and activity.
11. Scan for suspicious API calls.
12. Run anti-malware scans.
13. Document results and findings.
